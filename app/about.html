        ImageShrink is a new desktop application for easy photo compression. This app helps you quickly reduce your picture size or resolution. Optimize your
        images with a perfect balance in quality and file size.
      </p>
      <p class="about-paragraph">
        Based on the selected compression type, ImageShrink uses smart techniques to reduce the file size of your photos. The default compression technique is
        lossy - selectively decreasing the quality of the image, as fewer bytes are required to store the data. The effect is nearly invisible for lesser
        quality changes, but it makes a very large difference in file size. The other compression technique that can be selected is lossless - retain the
        quality of your images, while removing unnecessary metadata from the file.
      </p>
      <p class="about-paragraph">
        You donâ€™t have to manually save resized pictures, because they are automatically saved in a separate folder, mentioned in the output path section, and
        are accessible via your local file browser. If you want to quickly reduce the size of your pictures, ImageShrink is a perfect choice.
