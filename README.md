**Description**
---

ImageShrink is a new desktop application for easy photo compression. This app helps you quickly reduce your picture size or resolution. Optimize your images with a perfect balance in quality and file size.

**How it works**
---

Based on the selected compression type, ImageShrink uses smart techniques to reduce the file size of your photos. The default compression technique is lossy - selectively decreasing the quality of the image, as fewer bytes are required to store the data. The effect is nearly invisible for lesser quality changes, but it makes a very large difference in file size. The other compression technique that can be selected is lossless - retain the quality of your images, while removing unnecessary metadata from the file.

You donâ€™t have to manually save resized pictures, because they are automatically saved in a separate folder, mentioned in the output path section, and are accessible via your local file browser. If you want to quickly reduce the size of your pictures, ImageShrink is a perfect choice.

**Features**
---

* Support for .JPEG, .PNG and .GIF file types
* Selection of the compression type to be used when optimising your images
* Adjusting the quality of the image for lossy compression type - the lower the quality, the smaller the size file

* Very good quality of the compressed photos and optional compress quality
